Choosing the right tool to do the job can be hard. Recently the two programming languages that I have been using are Python and Rust. I believe that with these two languages I can solve a vast majority of the problems I wish to solve (especially if you throw some js/ts into the mix). Rust and Python are very different languages. Rust is compiled and Python is interpreted. Rust is statically typed and Python dynamically typed. Rust is a system level programming language and Python is a high level programming language.

I would like to explain why when starting a new project why I would choose one over the other. If we are talking performance Rust wins by a long shot; end of discussion. But I do think a discussion of just performance is missing the point. As a person that works at a startup I think an interesting dimension to explore when choosing is technology is certainty (thanks to [Theo ](https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg) for getting me to think about this dimension in the first place). In startup land, certainty can be considered how sure you are that your building is the right solution or even if anyone will care to use your product at all. With low certainty itâ€™s better to optimize for speed to change. The graph below is a visual reference to my thinking on this topic. The x axis represents low to high certainly and the y represents low to high performance. Performance we can define for this discussion as processing speed, memory usage and safety or how likely something is to fail in production (I could have pulled safety into its own dimension but for simplicity sake I wanted to draw a 2d graph).

In starting in the bottom left where certainty is low and performance is not as important. This quadrant is where I believe Python dominates. The ability to get something working fast is not rivaled by many languages. A quick script, a jupyter notebook or even the REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop). The iteration speed is superfast. Moving more towards the center of the graph this is where I believe that well tested Python applications lay.

In the opposite side of the where certainty high and performance is critical. This is where Rust dominates. With Rust being most of the time very close to the performance that you could get if writing in C. As well as Rust safety guarantees due from the brow checker and its use of error values. Make Rust one of the best applications that have high performance requirements with high certainty. This is where highly scalable applications with requirements already know lay. For example when planning to write some software that will live on our (my current employer) IOT cellular modem we decided to go with Rust. We decided to go with Rust because of the limitation of the modem hardware or in other words the need for performance. Also when releasing software running on hardware that is pushed over the air the certainty needs to be higher than some service deployed to AWS that can be rolled back in a matter of minutes.

In the bottom right of the graph where certainty is high and performance is not critical. This is where things that should not fail lay. This is where type hinted Python and Rust with its safety guarantees stated above are best.

Where certainty and performance is critical in the top left corner of the graph. There are two best options in my opinion. You can pull out performance critical parts of your application to Rust using [PyO3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3) and still write most of the application in Python. Or you can use unwrap on most result and option types. Although I love the results and option types in Rust for prototypes or creating software fast it can be verbose and tedious to handle properly. Using unwrap to only focus on the happy path can make building software in Rust a lot faster.
